# ChatApp using React

This is a real-time chat application built using React and Socket.IO. The app allows users to join a chat room and communicate with each other in real time.

# Front-end Dependencies
* Axios
* React-router-dom
* Socket.io-client
* Hooks (UseState, useContext, useEffect)
* RestApi

# Back-end Dependencies
* Dotenv
* Mongoose
* Socket.io
* Cors (helps to connect the front-end React with the server)
* Express
* Bcrypt (password hasher)

# Technologies Used

* Node.js: This is a JavaScript runtime environment that enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server side.
* React: This is a JavaScript library that allows the creation of interactive user interfaces.
* Express: This is a web application framework for Node.js that makes it easier to create web applications.
* Socket.IO: This is a library that enables real-time bidirectional communication between the client and server.
* Database: You will need a database to store the chat messages. I have used MongoDB and Mongoose.

# Functionality
* When a user connects to the application, their message is recorded on the server and they are added to the chat room.
* When a user sends a message, it is recorded on the server and saved to the MongoDB database. The message is then broadcast to all users in the chat room.
* When a user disconnects from the application, their message is recorded on the server and they are removed from the chat room.
